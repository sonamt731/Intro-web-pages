      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4"><p>For everything there is a season -- this applies to fashion just as much as anything else in life. Fashion divides itself into seasons which sometimes may be tough to keep up with. Fashion, unlike our regular seasons, can be split into the seasons Spring/Summer (collective) and Fall/Winter (collective). Brands create collections that accord with the seasons, showing ahead of time in order to establish dominant seasonal trends, and to help you plan and execute a fresh wardrobe by the time said season actually rolls around. However, there are a multitude of factors that are disrupting the current model, and they start and end with fast fashion and its effects on the industry’s ability to create.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><p> Let’s say XYZ brand debuts a really cool sequined coat on the runway that has media outlets and social media platforms buzzing post-show. You bookmark the look to refer to for the forthcoming season, but on your next trip to Forever 21 or H&M you see its exact doppelganger hanging on the rack at an unbelievably low price. The staggering fast fashion model has the ability to turn around a copycat look from runway to retail in two weeks… or less. Not only is this a horrifying notion when taking into consideration the extreme pressures that real humans undergo in order to physically execute these gigantic orders – not to mention the manufacturing of fabrics, packaging, and marketing that takes place as well – but it also has a detrimental effect on the creative process overall. Fast fashion’s rip-off game has landed it in hot water plenty of times before, but that hasn’t stopped these retail giants from running roughshod over the creatives who originated the concepts they are ripping off. Unfortunately, fast fashion is a paramount example of the pitfalls in the supply-and-demand economic system. We see an idea of something amazing on the runway, and in no time can own a scaled-down, poorly made version of it to wear and dispose of before the real version ever makes it to the store.</p></div>
        <div class="col-md-4"><p>How has the larger fashion industry responded to this? By adding more seasons. This is where it gets really confusing. The longstanding Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons actually don’t spend much time on the retail shelves (usually 2-3 months). So fashion has added Resort and Pre-Fall to the schedule, because they actually spend as long as six months on the retail shelves. It seems counterintuitive to introduce new seasons rather than to adjust the current model by extending the range a brand shows at Fashion Week, increase production time, and ensure that the seasonal lines stick around in stores longer. The main difference one can find between Resort and Pre-Fall and the traditional Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter seasons is that they are trans-seasonal in nature, which means they possess an aesthetic that is functional, travels easily, and is easily mixed-and-matched with other elements of a seasonal wardrobe.</p></div>
